    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A delicious blend of butter, sugar, chocolate chips, pecans, and oats that will satisfy any cookie lover.</p>
    <p>Recipe makes 4 to 5 dozen cookies.</p>
    <p>NOTE: Crushed pecans can be left out or substituted for crushed nut of choice. Any chocolate chips work fine, I use dark chocolate chips but I find most people prefer semisweet.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon of salt</li>
        <li>2 sticks of unsalted butter (softened)</li>
        <li>2/3 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>2/3 cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 cups rolled oats</li>
        <li>1 cup crushed pecan</li>
        <li>1 cup chocolate chips of choice</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <p>NOTE: Having 2 baking sheets speeds up cooking process a lot. I personally use 3 because my wire rack is very small. The third one stays on the counter as the final cooling area before cookies are stored.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees and grease baking sheets.</li>
        <li>Sift flour, salt, baking soda, and baking powder in a bowl. (if you do not have a sifter, vigorously whisk ingredients together in bowl for several minutes)</li>
        <li>Mix softened butter in a large bowl with electric mixer until it looks fluffy.</li>
        <li>Slowly add white sugar and brown sugar to butter and continue mixing until well mixed and fluffy.</li>
        <li>Add one egg at a time and continue mixing.</li>
        <li>Add vanilla and continue mixing.</li>
        <li>Slowly add flour mixture and continue mixing until well mixed and cookie dough has formed.</li>
        <li>Fold in chocolate chips, oats, and crushed pecans.</li>
        <li>Drop slightly smaller than golf ball sized scoops of dough onto greased baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake for 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Prepare next batch to bake.</li>
        <li>While next batch is baking allow to cool for at least 5 minutes on baking sheet before transferring cookies to wherever you have prepared to completely cool.</li>
    </ol>
